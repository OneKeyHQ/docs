# Introduction

[**OneKey**](https://www.onekey.so) is a wallet and browser extension that can be used to manage digital assets and access decentralized applications on the [Near](https://docs.near.org) blockchain.&#x20;

It works by creating and managing private keys on behalf of its users, allowing them to store funds and sign transactions.&#x20;

Web applications can interact with the extension wallet, such as asking for permission to perform a transaction.
