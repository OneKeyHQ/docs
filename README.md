## For Web Apps

If you are developing a dApp or a Web application and wish to use decentralized capabilities for on-chain interactions, OneKey injects many JavaScript objects into browsers. These objects facilitate interactions with mainstream chains and protocols like BTC, ETH, Lightning Network, Nostr, Cosmos, Polkadot, Sui, Aptos, and Solana.

We also support Wallet Connect. If your Web App is compatible with the Wallet Connect protocol, you can directly connect with OneKey.
