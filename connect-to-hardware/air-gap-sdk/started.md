Air Gap is a communication model based on QR codes that ensures an air-gapped transaction. OneKey acts as a pure signer for your crypto transactions, with Air Gap disabling external connections such as Bluetooth and USB. Its sole method of data transfer is through QR codes. This guide is intended for developers who want to integrate their services with OneKey.&#x20;

> Currently, Air Gap only supports the OneKey Pro model.



## Supported chains:
